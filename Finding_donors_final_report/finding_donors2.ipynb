    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes: This algorithm is useful for this application because it is looking for boolean classification of yes or no, either make more than 50k or less. This strength of this algorithm is trying to linearly separate the data into the 2 categories with the highest accuracy. It takes in consideration of \"naive\" features, since it assumes variables are independently contributing to the outcome, so it is very useful for this census data because there are many features in there that are hard to justify having a direct causation on income, such as native country. The weakness of this model would be the assumption that all variables are indepedent, which cannot be true all the time. A good example for real world application is text mining. Words such as \"hurry\" and \"up\" can use this algorithm to consider the probabilities of the two terms as one phrase, or by itself. (https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/naive-bayes-text-classification-1.html)\n",

    "2. Support Vector Machines (SVM): This algorithm is useful for this application because it is trying to draw the most linearly separable line between above or below 50k. The hyperplane created will create a decision boundaries with considerations to the outliers that can alter the classification. The strength of this algorithm is that it can tuned to have a more linear line, which we need here to classify into only two categories. The weakness would be the problem of overfitting, which is having too much complexity to describe the data. SVM was used in classfying pre-diabetics (https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6947-10-16)\n",

    "3. Logistic regression: This algorithm is useful for this application because its outcome will be dichotomous. This algorithm's strength is being able to also calculate the effects of each of the independent variable's on the outcome, which in this case is yes or no. The weaknesses of this algorithm is the weights of the indepedent variable. In this case, some independent variables might be important than others, and weights should be assigned to ensure the best classification. An example would be using logistic regression for GIS (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saro_Lee/publication/209803049_Application_of_logistic_regression_model_and_its_validation_for_landslide_susceptibility_mapping_using_GIS_and_remote_sensing_data_journals/links/571f042e08aed056fa2277a7/Application-of-logistic-regression-model-and-its-validation-for-landslide-susceptibility-mapping-using-GIS-and-remote-sensing-data-journals.pdf)"

GaussianNB() in this case was the first to be eliminated due to consistently much lower scores than logistic regression and SVC. However, SVC did take a exponentially longer amount of time to process and was also consistently a bit lower on scores compared to logistic regression.

    "**Answer: ** Logistic regression is a linear model that looks for probability of an event happening, based on the feature. This algorithm uses gets the odds of each variable with the event happening with p(^50k) = p/1-p, so a coin flip's odds of landing on heads would be occuring_prob/1-not_occuring_prob, which would be 1:1. Odds ratio is the ratio of two odds. So in this case, a variable such as capital_gain would have a higher odds ratio of having 50k, while a variable such as relationship. So if those 2 variables hypothetically have a odds ratio of 4.5, that means the odds of making ^50k with capital gain, is 4.5 times more likely than relationship category per 1 unit change. Logistic regression wants to estimate the probability of the event with a linear combination of the independent variables. The function is called \"logit\", which is the the natural log of the odds ratio, ln(p/1-p) = logit(p). Then, the inverse of logit(p), will return the linear combination of variables and the probability of being a \"1\", or being in the ^50k group. \n",

This is done by the \"logit\" function, which turns the odds of each variable, gets the ratio between them ,and does a natural log on it, which will return 1 and 0, 1 for above 50k, and 0 for below 50k.

The real ranking is married status, education, capital gain, hours per week, and age. I was close in guessin the features but not their ranking. I am guessing married status will file for joint income, which is a different tax bracket. Education as I thought was very predictive also. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
