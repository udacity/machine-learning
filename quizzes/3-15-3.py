Milt, we're gonna need to go ahead and move you downstairs into storage B. We have some new people coming in, and we need all the space we can get. So if you could just go ahead and pack up your stuff and move it down there, that would be terrific, OK?

#   Maximum Likelihood Hypothesis
#
#
#   In this quiz we will find the maximum likelihood word based on the preceding word
#
#   Fill in the NextWordProbability procedure so that it takes in sample text and a word,
#   and returns a dictionary with keys the set of words that come after, whose values are
#   the number of times the key comes after that word.
#
#   Just use .split() to split the sample_memo text into words separated by spaces.
