### Your regression goes here!
### Please name it reg, so that the plotting code below picks it up and 
### plots it correctly. Don't forget to change the test_color from "b" to "r"
### to differentiate training points from test points.








### draw the scatterplot, with color-coded training and testing points
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
for feature, target in zip(feature_test, target_test):
    plt.scatter( feature, target, color=test_color ) 
for feature, target in zip(feature_train, target_train):
    plt.scatter( feature, target, color=train_color ) 

### labels for the legend
plt.scatter(feature_test[0], target_test[0], color=test_color, label="test")
plt.scatter(feature_test[0], target_test[0], color=train_color, label="train")




### draw the regression line, once it's coded
try:
    plt.plot( feature_test, reg.predict(feature_test) )
except NameError:
    pass
plt.xlabel(features_list[1])
plt.ylabel(features_list[0])
plt.legend()
plt.show()
