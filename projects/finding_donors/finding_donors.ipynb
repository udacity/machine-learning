    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen to use: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines and AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naive Bayes**\n",
    "- Application: NB seems to be often applied in text classification problems, such as spam filtering and sentiment analysis. It also works well in real-time settings, because of its efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths: NB is a very simple algorithm, it's easy to implement and understand. It is fast to run and scale well with the number of data points (linearly). If the independency assumption holds, it converges really fast and yields very good results, but it also tends to perform well even when this assumption does not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: The naive assumption might make the algorithm perform poorly once it can't learn interactions between features. It is usually beaten by more complex algorithms when they're properly trained and tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why apply to our problem: The dataset we have is fairly small, so a complex algorithm might not yield nice results because it might need more data. Also some of the features individually, like education-num or capital gain might, by themselves, be good predictors of income and help NB perform nicely on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines**\n",
    "- Application: One popular use of SVM is in Image Processing, for example, for Image Classification and Face Detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths: SVM can model non-linear decision boundaries and work well in complex domains when there is a clear margin of separation. It tends to yield good accuracies and has some guarantees when it comes to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: It is memory intensive and does not scale well with the size of the dataset. It is not very robust to noisy data and can be tricky to tune due to the need to pick the right kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why apply to our problem: I think our dataset is small enough for it not to be a pain to run, but still large enought to get nice results. It's been cleansed, so noisy data shouldn't be an issue. Also, when it comes to income, there probably is a gap in some social aspects of people's life that explain the difference in income, like years of schooling, race and capital gains, that might make it feasible to stablish a margin of separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AdaBoost**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: Face detection and image classification also seems to be a popular application of AdaBoost, it can successfully combine simple image features to identify complex objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strengths: Ensemble methods are robust to outliers, scalable, naturally model non-linear decision boundaries due to the hierarchical structure of the underlying trees. They also are easier to tune and AdaBoost is guaranteed not to overfit. Furthermore, these methods tend to be the winner approach in classification problems, performing well in a wide range of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weaknesses: Once trees don't support online learning, every time you have new data, you need to rebuild the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why apply to our problem: It works well in a wide range of problems and is guaranteed not to overfit. Plus, looking at the problem, it seems like trees could nicely separate the population based on a set of features to identify the groups according to their earnings using multiple decision boundaries hierarchically.\n",

The second best model, SVM, performs slightly worse than AdaBoost when using the entire training set. However, SVM takes much more time to train and predict, requiring much more computing power to scale with larger datasets and slowing down the process of model tuning. Furthermore, the structure of the problem seems well suited for a DecisionTree, that can separate the population using several decision boudaries hierarchically according to the amount of information each split provides. With AdaBoost we combine several simple models of such trees into a much more powerfull and robust model, that can get great results both on training and test sets."

    "The AdaBoost model is what is called an ensemble model. Such types of models receive this name because they combine (or ensemble) several simpler models into a single one. In this case, the underlying model is a decision tree. A decision tree works by going through the data and finding the feature that says the most about it, it splits the data according to the values of that feature and then, for each part of the split dataset, it tries to identify which is, again, the feature that is most important. This process might repeat several times, producing ever deeper tress. But, for AdaBoost and other ensemble methods, those threes are usually small, so that they don't perform very well individually, in fact, we could say each tree individually is little more than useless. AdaBoost then combines those simple trees in a special way. Once a tree is trained, AdaBoost identifies the examples that are being wrongly classified and give them greater importance when training the next one. That way, each new tree focus on learning specially better those kinds of datapoints that their previous peers couldn't get right. In the end, all trees are gathered to vote to determine the class for each datapoint we want to predict and the result of the voting is the model's prediction."

Age also has a role on predicting earning once people tend to get better payed as they get more work experience. Finally, race could potentially be a good predictor as some etnic groups have been historically disfavored and have less access to education and income."

    "**Answer:** My guess was certainly close to the final results, as I just got some ordering wrong and missed one feature. As I mentioned, capital gain and capital loss should be good predictors, but losses are more important, probably because it's a better predictor for someone as being low earner. Age is really an important predictor, even more than education, which apparently is less important than I though, but I believe it might be sharing some importance with the features for education level, as they are clearly correlated. Finally, race doesn't appear in the top-5, hours-per-week appears instead, that is probably a more direct indicative of access to employment."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
