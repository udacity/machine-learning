    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "* Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "  * Gaussian Navie Bayes is commonly used for document classification, such as classifying email as spam or not spam or possibily cataloging news articles by tags such as sports, cooking, local, etc.\n",
    "  * This model's strengths include its speed and simplicity. It performs well on datasets with multiple independent variables, and is best on datasets with few or none dependant variables.\n",
    "  * The model assumes all features are independent and can can issues with dependant features\n",
    "  * This model would be good for selecting donors, because the model would allow us to examine all the features as independent features to find different combinations of features to select donors. \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Ensemble Method - Random Forest\n",
    "  * There are several possible usages of Random Forest, product recommendations or finding financial fraud (Polamuri, 2017).\n",
    "  * Prevents overfitting from typical decision trees, and can model categorical values.  It can also be used for feature engineering (Polamuri, 2017).\n",
    "  * Random forests are unable to predict values outside of the training data range. The fit of the random forest is directly affected by the quality of data provided to the model (Benyamin, 2012). \n",
    "  * Random forest works well with a mixture of data types, and is well suited for a multiclass problem  (Lanenok, 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Support Vector Machines\n",
    "  * Real world application: Face Detection, image classification, hand writing recognition (\"Real-Life Applications of SVM (Support Vector Machines) - DataFlair,\" 2018).\n",
    "  * Strengths: Works best when the data has a clear separation line; usefuly in highly dimensional data (Ray, 2017).\n",
    "  * Weakness:  Poor performance over large datasets due to high training time. Can not directly predict or estimate (Ray, 2017). \n",
    "  * SVM is a good algorithm for when the data does not have a distinct linear separation. \n",

    "To properly evaluate the performance of each model you've chosen, it's important that you create a training and predicting pipeline that allows you to quickly and effectively train models using various sizes of training data and perform predictions on the testing data. Your implementation here will be used in the following section.\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Import `fbeta_score` and `accuracy_score` from [`sklearn.metrics`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics).\n",
    " - Fit the learner to the sampled training data and record the training time.\n",
    " - Perform predictions on the test data `X_test`, and also on the first 300 training points `X_train[:300]`.\n",

    "Random forest works by building a forest of decision trees.  The result from each decision tree is factored into the final result, which would be the most common result from all the decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest is one of several ensemble learning classifiers.  Ensemble learning works by combining several simple individual models together to improve the predictions of the model (SRIVASTAVA, 2015), reduce variance, and bias of the model. A simple model in this case would a decision tree.  A decision tree is a flowchart like process of questioning data, and viewing the requests of the question.  An example of a decision would be the board game \"Guess Who.\"  This game is a guessing game where a series of questions is asked and the players eventually try to guess which person is being described from the board of people.  During each turn the player is asking a question of the data, viewing the results, and asking another question which generates a smaller set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest constructs different multiple trees, by randomly selecting a group of features, then building a decision tree on those features.  The random foreset will then create another decision tree, by randomly selecting another group of features, and building a tree.  This process continues over a number of decision trees we defined is reached.  This process could result in features of the dataset being used repeated in different decision trees, and this random repeatedness helps expose new relationship in the data, and reduce overfitting caused by decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest can take a couple of different methods to aggregate the different trees into a single model depending on whether is classification or regression. Typically for classification problems, the results of each tree would be voted on by comparing the vote to the average vote for the feature.  In a regression problem, an average of all the predictions for all the trees would be taken to determine how to make a prediction.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

I went back to try to tune the grid search to get higher results, which then ran for several days.  Ulimately the larger training set was lost due to Chrome updating and closing out the Jupyter notebook tabs.  I went back with a more targeted grid search, but was only able to get .001 of a percent increase in accuracy. I would consider using the reduced data set as a training set.  It provides only a 2% loss of accuracy compared to the whole dataset and the slightly lose of accuracy would not be a significant issue, because there is little repercussion other than the lose of resources to send out untargeted donation requests.
