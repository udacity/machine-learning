In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

In other words, we need enough training points to make the training and testing curves converge(if it will converge), it helps us to know which model is overfitting or underfitting. For example, with max_depth = 3, 300~350 training points is enough for the curves converging. But with max_depth = 6, it might need about 1000 training points to (try to) make it converge, means max_depth = 6 might be overfitting."

    "The Grid Search technique is an exhaustive search over specified parameter values for an estimator.\n",
    "When a learning algorithm has multible hyperparameters need to be optimized, we can manually specified parameters in a grid, then use cross-validation to choose the best one. For example, if we want to know what is the best values of C(0.1, 1, 10) and kernel(linear, polynomial) for a SVM classifier, we can exhaustive evaluate all the combination of (C, kernel), that is, in a grid of [[0.1, linear], [0.1, polynominal], [1, linear], [1, polynominal], [10, linear], [10, polynominal]]. Then use cross-validation to choose the optimized value of C and kernel, e.g. C=1 and kernel=linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate a combination of parameters, we can use *accuracy*(or *fbeta score*) for classification and *r2 score* for regression, or specify via the scoring parameter to sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV and sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to Random Search, Grid Search typically gives the best combination but it can take a lot of time.\n",
    "That is because, if we want to avoid the situation of too less trials with important(more effective) parameters(which might miss the best optimized value), we must increase the trials to ensure the grid is sufficient tight.\n",

    "we use fi for validation and the remaining k-1 subsets for training.  \n",

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
