In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "Given the graphs above, the optimal maximum depth (MD) for the model would be 3. Even though the training score gets better consistently with higher values for the MD, what we really care for is the performance in conjunction with the testing set. The testing set, on the other hand, gets a lower score with a MD greater than 3.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The score of the training curve gets worse the more number of training points we use. This means that the model is having problems to fit the data perfectly the more points we give it, and this in turn tells us how much our model is overfitting. Looking at the graphs we can conclude that the higher the MD, the less this curve decays given more points, and this points to higher overfitting.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The model would not necessarily benefit much if we gave it more data, especially if we set the MD to 3. At this hyperparameter the model curves converge to an R2 score close to 0.8, both for the training and the testing set, this tells us that our model wont do better with more data. It has reached a plateau. In order to have better results we would need a more powerful model that could make use of the extra data.  "

    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "The model trained with an MD of 1 shows a high bias. The model is too simple for the problem at hand and it underfits. A decision tree with a depth of 1 is equivalent to a logistic regression where the line is bound to be parallel to an axis, it is too restrictive to give good results. In the graph you can see this because the score is in its lowest value.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "On the other end, when the model is trained with an MD of 10 it shows a high variance. This is because the model overfits the training data. This can be seen in the graph because the testing score gets worse, and it diverges from the train score."

    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

    "I would choose an MD of value 3. It is true that a value of 4 would give a slightly better score, but I think the complexity added is not rewarded enough. This is especially true given that the decision tree models are meant to be highly interpretable. Also, the two curves start to diverge precisely at MD 4."

    "K-fold cross validation is a technique used to get the most out of the data available. Instead of spliting the data into train and test sets and only use the training data to tune our model, we define a k value which represents the number of folds we will split our data (all our data) into. We then train our model using one fold as our test data and the rest as our training data, and we do this k times, each time using a different fold as our test set. We will end up with k different meassurements of the performance of our model, which we average. But more importantly, we will use all our data to train our model, without the risk of overfitting! <br>\n",

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
