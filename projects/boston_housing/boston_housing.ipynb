    "In this final section of the project, you will make a prediction on the client's feature set using an optimized model from `fit_model`. When applying grid search along with cross-validation to optimize your model, it would typically be performed and validated on a training set and subsequently evaluated on a **dedicated test set**. In this project, the optimization below is performed on the *entire dataset* (as opposed to the training set you made above) due to the many outliers in the data. Using the entire dataset for training provides for a less volatile prediction at the expense of not testing your model's performance. \n",
