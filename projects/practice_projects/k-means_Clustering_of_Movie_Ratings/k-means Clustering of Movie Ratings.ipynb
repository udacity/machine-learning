[The Netflix Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) tried to push the envelope in this area by offering a prize of US$1,000,000 to the recommendation algorithm that shows the most improvement over Netflix's own recommendation algorithm.\n",
    "* That prize was granted in 2009 to a team called \"BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos\". [This paper](http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/GrandPrize2009_BPC_BigChaos.pdf) shows their approach which employed an ensemble of a large number of methods. \n",

What other movies did the user sample in this session? Did they start watching a movie then stop and switch to a different movie? These new data points offered a lot more clues than the ratings alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Take it Further\n",
    "\n",
    "* This notebook showed user-level recommendations. We can actually use the almost exact code to do item-level recommendations. These are recommendations like Amazon's \"Customers who bought (or viewed or liked) this item also bought (or viewed or liked)\". These would be recommendations we can show on each movie's page in our app. To do this, we simple transpose the dataset to be in the shape of Movies X Users, and then cluster the movies (rather than the users) based on the correlation of their ratings.\n",
    "* We used the smallest of the datasets Movie Lens puts out. It has 100,000 ratings. If you want to dig deeper in movie rating exploration, you can look at their [Full dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) containing 24 million ratings.\n",
