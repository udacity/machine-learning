    "**Strengths of Naive Bayes**: Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm performs well when the input variables are categorical. A Naïve Bayes classifier converges faster, requiring relatively little training data than other discriminative models like logistic regression, when the Naïve Bayes conditional independence assumption holds. With Naïve Bayes Classifier algorithm, it is easier to predict class of the test data set. Though it requires conditional independence assumption, Naïve Bayes Classifier has presented good performance in various application domains\n",

    "**The weakness of Naive Bayes** of the model is assumption about conditional independence. If features have strong correlations, it could doesn't perform well\n",

    "**Naive Bayes is a good candidate** for the problem because: we have some categorical and text features, some features are conditionaly independent. Also if it would be efficient model, we can collect additional categorical and text features and build potentially more precise model. \n",

    "**Random Forest algorithms are used** by banks to predict if a loan applicant is a likely high risk, in the healthcare industry to predict if a patient is likely to develop a chronic disease or not, the algorithm has also made way into predicting patterns in speech recognition software and classifying images and texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths of Random Forest** - overfitting is less of an issue with Random Forests, unlike decision tree machine learning algorithms. It is relatively easily to build a decent model without much tuning. It is not require any input preparation and algoritm is capable of handling numerical, binary and categorical features, without scaling, transformation or modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses of Random Forest**: it is difficult to analyse them. It can be slow for calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest is a good candidate** for the problem because: it is proven algoritm for classification problem with high accuracy, we can easy to test it (no much fine-tune), it maintains accuracy when there is missing data and is also resistant to outliers (it could be case for this dataset or in the future when dataset will be bigger). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression Classifier is used** in the following fields. Life insurance actuaries use logistic regression to predict, based on given data on a policy holder (e.g. age, gender, results from a physical examination) the chances that the policy holder will die before the term of the policy expires. Political campaigns try to predict the chances that a voter will vote for their candidate (or do something else desirable, such as donate to the campaign).\n",

Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

So, using the training data Logistic Regression gives each feature a weight. The principle is following: if we take each student case from training data and based on selected weights for each feature calculate pass student or not, the average result (% of corrected answers) will be maximal possible.\n",
    "2. To be more simple:please see on the picture below. On training data we have a lot of cases  - blue points cases (student pass) and red points cases (student not passed). Also we have some features (each dimension of cube is a feature). We calculate potimal weights to build green surface - border which is separate the category of cases (pass or not) with maximum possible accuracy on training data. Now - when new case will come we will calculate the coordintates when new points should be placed (based on feature value, weights and some transformation) and can plot the point for new case inside the cube. If new point is placed above the green surface - we expect the student will pass, if below, not pass.\n",

So we need to apply the result to a special function called Sigmoid/Logistic function, to get the probability. If probability is high (e.g >50%) we classify case as passed. If low - not pass"
