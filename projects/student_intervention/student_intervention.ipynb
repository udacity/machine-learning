    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "2. K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "3. Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gaussian Naive Bayes : This is an eager learner algorithm, meaning that the accuracy of the classification remains the same once the training data has been \"learnt\". It is used in security and mail filtering software, particularly to determine if a given email is spam. This works well on relatively small datasets with low variance. However, it is naive in the sense that it assumes that the features used in training are independent. Given the small number of features (30) and datapoints (395), it might be good to try out Naive Bayes on our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. K-Nearest Neighbors : This is a lazy learner and the current training set determines the accuracy of the test data classification. It is used in the recommender systems. It handles multi-class/ multi-label cases very well and has the ability to incorporate distance and weights. However, it requires large amount of training data to be stored and has a high compute requirement to classify every test point. In our case, our dataset is small enough that storing it is not an issue and K-Neighbors will work well if the dat is noisy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Decision Trees : This is another eager learner and is easy to interpret. It is used to determine possibility of credit card fraud (FICO). This approach works very well when the dataset has missing attributes, but performs poorly with noisy data. Decision trees can draw non-linear boundaries, which is good for multi-feature/ multi-label dataset.\n",

    "The decision tree algorithm works by finding classifying the data into subsets based on features. It picks the feature that leads to the clearest separataion between the datasets first and then subsequently sub-groups each set based on the next set of features. The idea is to pick out the feature that most clearly delineates the data into the different groups and then recursively continue until there are no more data points left to classify. After classifying the training data, the algorithm then draws a \"Decision boundary\", based on which any new data points will be classified.\n",

The key parameters to consider are depth of the tree (how many nodes), number of features considered in each level and minimum number of points for each sub-set.
