If data for previous students who both graduated and failed to do so were available at multiple times throughout their academic careers, a regression problem could be formulated that output continuous risk assessments (i.e. probabilities of failure to graduate) for existing students.*"

Given a data set with age, loan amount, credit history/score, income, and assets as features and whether or not the loan was defaulted as the label.  The model is simple and easy to explain, and performs well on moderately noisy data sets (since averaging is done over nearest neighbors).  When the data set is large, K-Nearest Neighbors can perform poorly due to large training time and memory requirements (all data must be stored for doing the averaging).  Also, choice of different K and distance function can result in different labeling of test data.  K-Nearest Neighbors is a good candidate for this problem since there relatively few data points (<400).\n",

Given a data set with test scores, gender (M/F/Und), played sports flag (Y/N), and high-school GPA are features and whether or not the student was admitted as the label.  The model is very robust, and has great connection to margin maximization when constructing decision boundaries.  The model performs well on most any training data set, provided the underlying classifier chosen as the simple combination algorithm does not suffer from overfitting (e.g. like ANN with high weights).  Additionally, boosting actually performs better on test sets when using larger training sets owing to the algorithms' structure.  Owing to the averaging over individual hypotheses, choice of classifier for the simple algorithm in adaBoost is not as important as in other algorithms (e.g. SVMs).  As mentioned previously, boosting can overfit when using a combination algorithm that suffers from overfitting.  AdaBoost is a good candidate for this problem since it maximizes vector margin similar to SVM for small feature sets.\n",

    "*Support Vector Machines(SVM):  One-real world application in industry where the model can be applied is for handwriting recognition (from Wikipedia SVM page).  The model is easy to program to handle simple linearly separable data sets (e.g. those where a hyperplane can be used as the decision boundary).  It also can be used to handle non-feature input vectors (e.g. strings, other classifiers).  The model faces the weakness of selection of appropriate kernel function when facing a nonlinear decision boundary within the training data.  SVMs are appropriate for this problem given the structure and size of the input vector, and the flexibility of classification via the use of a nonlinear kernel function."

    "### Implementation: Model Performance Metrics\n",
    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",
    " - Use a `random_state` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    " - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Create the different training set sizes to be used to train each model.\n",
    " - *Do not reshuffle and resplit the data! The new training points should be drawn from `X_train` and `y_train`.*\n",
    "- Fit each model with each training set size and make predictions on the test set (9 in total).  \n",
    "**Note:** Three tables are provided after the following code cell which can be used to store your results."
