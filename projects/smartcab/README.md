## Project: Train a Smartcab How to Drive

### Getting Started
In this project, you will work towards constructing an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a *Smartcab* through its environment towards a goal. Since the *Smartcab* is expected to drive passengers from one location to another, the driving agent will be evaluated on two very important metrics: **Safety** and **Reliability**. A driving agent that gets the *Smartcab* to its destination while running red lights or narrowly avoiding accidents would be considered **unsafe**. Similarly, a driving agent that frequently fails to reach the destination in time would be considered **unreliable**. Maximizing the driving agent's **safety** and **reliability** would ensure that *Smartcabs* have a permanent place in the transportation industry.

**Safety** and **Reliability** are measured using a letter-grade system as follows:

| Grade 	| Safety 	| Reliability 	|
|:-----:	|:------:	|:-----------:	|
|   A+  	|  Agent commits no traffic violations,<br/>and always chooses the correct action. | Agent reaches the destination in time<br />for 100% of trips. |
|   A   	|  Agent commits few minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 90% of trips. |
|   B   	| Agent commits frequent minor traffic violations,<br/>such as failing to move on a green light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 80% of trips. |
|   C   	|  Agent commits at least one major traffic violation,<br/> such as driving through a red light. | Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 70% of trips. |
|   D   	| Agent causes at least one minor accident,<br/> such as turning left on green with oncoming traffic.       	| Agent reaches the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |
|   F   	|  Agent causes at least one major accident,<br />such as driving through a red light with cross-traffic.      	| Agent fails to reach the destination on time<br />for at least 60% of trips. |

To assist evaluating these important metrics, you will need to load visualization code that will be used later on in the project. Run the code cell below to import this code which is required for your analysis.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** with the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
) library installed

### Code

Template code is provided in the `smartcab/agent.py` python file. Additional supporting python code can be found in `smartcab/enviroment.py`, `smartcab/planner.py`, and `smartcab/simulator.py`. Supporting images for the graphical user interface can be found in the `images` folder. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality for the `LearningAgent` class in `agent.py` when requested to successfully complete the project. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```

This will run the `agent.py` file and execute your agent code.
