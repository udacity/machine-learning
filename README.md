## Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Check the jupyter notebook here: [boston_housing.ipynb](https://github.com/jo4x962k7JL/udacity_MLND/blob/master/projects/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb)

- This is the project after learning the **"Model Evaluation and Validation"** section.
- In this project, we go through the basic ML(machine learning) procedures and get the predicted selling price for clients' home. These procedures include:
  1. Data Exploration(statistically)
  2. Utilize techniques like GridSearch and CrossValidation to optimize our learning algorithm/model
  3. Analyzing Model Performance using Learning Curves and Complexity Curves
  4. Finally, train(fit) the model and predict the selling prices
- The dataset for this project originates from the "UCI Machine Learning Repository",
but for simplicity, we only use 489 data points and 3 features(variables) to predict
the median value of clients' houses.
- At the first time I passed this project, the R2 score is 0.7435. After I completed whole Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree, I redesign the model in 5 mins, and get the R2 score of 0.8269.
